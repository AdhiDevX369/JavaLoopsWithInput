<h1>JavaLoopsWithInput</h1>

This repository contains Java programs that use loops and input from the user.

<h2>Programs</h2>
<ol type = "1">
<li>Summing numbers: Asks the user to input a series of numbers and then calculates the sum of those numbers using a loop.</li>
<li>Counting occurrences: Asks the user to input a string and a character, and then counts the number of occurrences of that character in the string using a loop.</li>
<li>Password validation: Asks the user to input a password and then checks if it meets certain criteria, such as containing at least one uppercase letter and one number. Uses a loop to keep asking the user for input until a valid password is entered.</li>
<li>Guessing game: Generates a random number between 1 and 100 and then asks the user to guess what that number is. Uses a loop to keep asking the user for guesses until they guess correctly.</li>
<li>Prime number detection: Asks the user to input a number and then checks if it is a prime number using a loop. Keeps dividing the number by all integers from 2 to the square root of the number, and if none of them divide the number evenly, it is a prime number.</li>
<li>Fibonacci sequence: Asks the user to input a number and then prints out the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence using a loop. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting with 0 and 1.</li>
<li>Multiplication table: Asks the user to input a number and then prints out the multiplication table for that number using a loop. The multiplication table is a table showing the products of multiplying the number by all integers from 1 to 10.</li>
